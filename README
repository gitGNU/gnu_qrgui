ABOUT QRGUI
===========
Qrgui is a minimalistic GUI-based front-end for qrencode, a command line based
QR code generator. Qrgui is written in bash, and uses Zenity
<http://live.gnome.org/Zenity> to make the dialog boxes.

Qrgui should work on any GNU/Linux distribution that can run Zenity.
There are no plans to port it to Windows or Mac OS X, because:
    On Windows, Qrgui would have to be rewritten as a batch file;
    On Mac OS X, Zenity is not available, to my knowledge.
